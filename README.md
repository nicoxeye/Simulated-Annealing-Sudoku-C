# Simulated Annealing For Sudoku
The random sudoku board is generated by using functions from my previous project called 'Sudoku-C' :)

Passing your own board is also possible, just change 
```
int grid[SIZE][SIZE];
```
into your own 9x9 sudoku board filled with 0's as the gaps.

### BUILDING THE APP:
```
gcc main.c sudoku.c -o sa_solvedsudoku
```
run either the .exe app in the folder or by cmd
